**Describe what the environment is supposed to be and why it is important to you:**

For the environment of the portrait, I wanted to emulate a vaporwave aesthetic, which typically involves shades of pink and teal and imagry from the 80's and 90's. 
Unfortunately due to time, I omited the 80's and 90's imagry in the final program. 

**Write a short description of any difficulties you had or anything interesting you discovered:**

The biggest difficulty I found was in filling in the spaces of polygons that had more than four corners. 
This is why there is a stain-glass appearence to features that have been filled in on the portrait. 
Time also became a major factor in creating this piece. 
The biggest bottleneck was in generating the coordinates and and natural fill-in colors of the portrait.
In hindsight, I feel I should have went with a more abstract interpretation of a self-portrait.
