**Describe what the environment is supposed to be and why it is important to you:**

For the environment of the portrait, I wanted to emulate a vaporwave aesthetic, which typically involves shades of pink and teal and imagery from the 80's and 90's. I felt that I could reference 90's imagery by emulating early 3D graphics in my portrait(see Figure 2).

**Write a short description of any difficulties you had or anything interesting you discovered:**

The biggest difficulty I found was in filling in the spaces of polygons that had more than four corners. This is why there is a stain-glass appearence to features that have been filled in on the portrait. Time also became a major factor in creating this piece. The biggest bottleneck was in generating the coordinates and and natural fill-in colors of the portrait. In hindsight, I feel I should have went with a more abstract interpretation of a self-portrait.
