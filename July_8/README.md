**Describe what the environment is supposed to be and why it is important to you:**

For the environment of the portrait, I wanted to emulate a vaporwave aesthetic, which typically involves shades of pink and teal and imagery from the 80's and 90's. I felt that I could reference 90's imagery by emulating early 3D graphics in my portrait(see Figure 2).

**Write a short description of any difficulties you had or anything interesting you discovered:**

The biggest difficulty I found was in filling in the spaces of polygons that had more than four corners as it took the most time in the self-portrait making process. The biggest bottleneck was in generating the coordinates. In hindsight, I feel I should have went with a more abstract interpretation of a self-portrait.
