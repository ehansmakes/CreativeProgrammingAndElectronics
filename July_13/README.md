For this assignment I decided to create two patterns use "for()" loops.

Pattern 1 was inspired by a photo that I found on reddit of a sunset between two buildings [see Pattern_1_Inspiration.jpg].

I came up with pattern 2 when I was brainstorm interlocking geometry that was more complicated than a square. I decided to use what I learned in creating a color gradient in Pattern_1 in Pattern_2 as well. I felt this gave the overall image more "depth". 

**Difficulties**
1) Creating the code that would generate the color gradients in both patterns
2) Establishing the shape of the arrow to ensure the pattern would interlock 
3) Printing out the finished pattern without using theb "Print Screen" command. See Discoveries 1 for the solution I used. 
4) Trying to get the correct syntax for the "for()" loops took some getting use to at the begining. 

**Discoveries**
1) I found using the "saveFrame(}" ensured I wasn't leaving anything out when trying to capture an image. It certainly a lot clean than using "Screen Print" and editing in MS Paint.
